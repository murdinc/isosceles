Remote Development Tool Roll

This is a cli/tool build out of a desire to work locally in an environment setup for remote development. I got tired of the lag of a mounted sshfs volume, and saw some of the tools my friends were using to solve the same problem. It's main and only feature is "active-sync", currently - but I hope to add more utilities to it as needed.
